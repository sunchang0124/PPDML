# PPDML (Privacy-preserving Distributed Machine Learning)

This repository will show several machine learning in privacy-preserving manner when the data is vertically partitioned. 
The following algorithms have been applied:
* Linear Regression
* Naive Bayes
* Secure multiparty computation

Please have a look at the first implementation: privacy-preserving linear regression in vertically partitioned data.
